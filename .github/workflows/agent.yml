# Shim workflow — copy this to your target repo at .github/workflows/agent.yml

# This is all you need in each repo that uses Remote Dev Bot.
# The real logic lives in gnovak/remote-dev-bot and updates automatically.
#
# Prerequisites (see runbook.md for details):
#   - Repository secrets: at least one LLM API key + PAT_TOKEN
#   - Actions permissions: read/write + allow PR creation
#
# To test against a dev branch of remote-dev-bot, change @main to @dev below.
